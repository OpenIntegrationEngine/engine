Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **Open Integration Engine** project. Contributions are vital to the continued growth and success of the project, and we welcome all forms of participation, whether you are a developer, a documentation contributor, or a user providing feedback.

The contribution process is straightforward and can be completed in a few simple steps:

## How to Contribute

### 1. Open an Issue
Before making any changes, please open an issue in the [GitHub Issues Tracker](https://github.com/OpenIntegrationEngine/engine/issues). This step helps us discuss the problem or feature before work begins, ensuring alignment and reducing redundant efforts.

### 2. Fork the Repository
Start by forking the [Open Integration Engine GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenIntegrationEngine/engine) to your own GitHub account.

### 3. Clone Your Fork
Clone your fork locally to your development environment:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:OpenIntegrationEngine/engine.git
```

### 4. Make Changes
Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```
Implement the necessary changes, ensuring that they align with the projectâ€™s coding standards and practices.

### 5. Test Your Changes
Before submitting your changes, please ensure that all tests pass and that your changes work as expected in your local environment.

### 6. Submit a Pull Request
Once your changes are ready, push them to your fork and create a **draft pull request (PR)** from your branch to the `main` branch of the project. Draft PRs help indicate that the work is in progress.  
Mark the PR as **"Ready for review"** only when it is actually complete and ready for feedback. Include a brief description of the changes and reference the related issue.
